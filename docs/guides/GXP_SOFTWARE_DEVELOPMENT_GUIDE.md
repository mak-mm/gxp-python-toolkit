2. **Audit Trails**: Secure, computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails
3. **Access Controls**: Authority checks and user authentication
4. **Electronic Signatures**: Equivalent to handwritten signatures
5. **Data Integrity**: Prevention of data manipulation or loss

### EU Annex 11

The European Union's Annex 11 provides guidance on computerized systems used in GMP environments.

#### Key Principles:
1. **Risk Management**: Risk-based approach to validation
2. **Personnel**: Adequate training and access management
3. **Suppliers and Service Providers**: Formal agreements and audits
4. **Validation**: Documented evidence of system suitability
5. **Data**: Ensuring data integrity throughout lifecycle
6. **Accuracy Checks**: Built-in checks for critical data

## Core GxP Principles {#core-gxp-principles}

### ALCOA+ Data Integrity Principles

All GxP data must be:

- **A**ttributable: Data can be traced to its source
- **L**egible: Data is readable and permanent
- **C**ontemporaneous: Data is recorded at time of activity
- **O**riginal: First capture or true copy
- **A**ccurate: Data is correct and truthful
- **+Complete**: All data including metadata is present
- **+Consistent**: Data is created in a repeatable manner
- **+Enduring**: Data is preserved throughout retention period
- **+Available**: Data can be accessed when needed

### Quality by Design (QbD)

Software should be designed with quality built in from the start:
1. Define quality attributes upfront
2. Design systems to meet these attributes
3. Build in controls and checks
4. Continuously monitor and improve

### Risk-Based Approach

Focus validation efforts based on:
- Patient safety impact
- Product quality impact
- Data integrity impact
- Regulatory compliance impact

## Best Practices {#best-practices}

### Development Practices

1. **Code Quality**
   ```python
   # Use type hints for clarity
   def calculate_batch_yield(
       theoretical_yield: float,
       actual_yield: float
   ) -> float:
       """Calculate batch yield percentage with validation."""
       if theoretical_yield <= 0:
           raise ValueError("Theoretical yield must be positive")
       return (actual_yield / theoretical_yield) * 100
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   # Comprehensive error handling with context
   try:
       result = process_batch_data(batch_id)
   except ValidationError as e:
       logger.error(
           f"Validation failed for batch {batch_id}",
           extra={
               "batch_id": batch_id,
               "error": str(e),
               "user": current_user.id
           }
       )
       raise
   ```

3. **Documentation**
   ```python
   def approve_batch_release(
       batch_id: str,
       approver: User,
       password: str
   ) -> BatchApproval:
       """
       Approve batch for release with electronic signature.

       Args:
           batch_id: Unique batch identifier
           approver: User performing approval
           password: User password for signature

       Returns:
           BatchApproval object with signature details

       Raises:
           PermissionError: User lacks approval rights
